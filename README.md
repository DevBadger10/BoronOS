My OS based on Poncho's OS Dev series.
This is based on Poncho's OS Dev series. If you want to make one yourself, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpPbKEeWIHU&list=PLxN4E629pPnJxCQCLy7E0SQY_zuumOVyZ. All credit for the fundamentals goes to Poncho.

You may not distribute this volume any way, shape or form. You can use it for inspiration or reference when making your own OS or curious about the inner workings, but credit must be given.
