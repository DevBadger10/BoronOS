# BoronOS

This is the old version, when I was trying to make it from scratch. I am now using CosmOS. See the new repository at [this link](https://www.github.com/ProjectBoron/BoronOS).

If you want to veiw former versions, check the commit history.

While it was fun making one from scratch and writing the bare code, it was also just too hard to continue.
